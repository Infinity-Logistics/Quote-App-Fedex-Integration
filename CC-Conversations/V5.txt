> I'd like to resume from /Users/chinmay/Documents/Projects/Lead-To-Rev/Clients/Infinity-Logistics/Fedex-Integration-Docs/CC-Conversations/V4.txt

⏺ I'll read the file to see where we left off.

⏺ Read(~/Documents/Projects/Lead-To-Rev/Clients/Infinity-Logistics/Fedex-Integration-Docs/CC-Conversations/V4.txt)
  ⎿  Read 507 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I've reviewed V4.txt - Phase 2: Data Model Updates was completed successfully.

  What was completed:
  - Modified JobOrder.model.js with carrier-agnostic fields:
    - Added stateOrProvinceCode to location details
    - Added dutiesPaymentType to containerInfo
    - Added shipmentPurpose to exportDeclaration
  - Implemented pre-save hooks for auto-calculation
  - Added helper methods (getDutiesPaymentType(), getShipmentPurpose(), isStateRequired())
  - All 7 verification tests passed

  Next Phase:
  Phase 3: Transformer Layer

  What would you like to do?
  1. Proceed to Phase 3
  2. Review/modify Phase 2
  3. Something else

> Let us proceed to Phase-3 now. You can checkout it's exact details from
/Users/chinmay/Documents/Projects/Lead-To-Rev/Clients/Infinity-Logistics/Fedex-Integration-Docs/04-Complete-Implementation-Roadmap.md file. Pls first gather the context
properly, and proceed with the implementation in ultrathink mode

⏺ I'll gather the context from the roadmap and proceed with Phase 3 implementation.

⏺ Now I'll create the DHL and FedEx transformers based on the existing implementation.

⏺ ✅ Phase 3: Transformer Layer - Complete!

  Files Created:

  1. src/transformers/CarrierTransformer.interface.js (4KB)
    - Abstract base class for all carrier transformers
    - Defines required methods for rate and shipment transformations
    - Includes helper methods (isSinglePackage, getTotalPackageCount, formatDate, etc.)
    - Prevents direct instantiation
  2. src/transformers/DHLTransformer.js (17KB)
    - Extends CarrierTransformer
    - Extracted all transformation logic from existing DHL implementation
    - Key methods:
        - transformRateRequestSingle() - Single package rate query params
      - transformRateRequestMulti() - Multi-package rate request body
      - transformShipmentRequest() - Complete DHL shipment creation
      - Helper methods for addresses, packages, customs, value-added services
    - Handles package quantity expansion (2 boxes → 2 separate entries)
    - Auto-adds DD/DS service codes based on incoterm
  3. src/transformers/FedExTransformer.js (26KB)
    - Extends CarrierTransformer
    - Complete FedEx API integration based on documentation
    - Key methods:
        - transformRateRequest() - FedEx rate quotes API format
      - transformShipmentRequest() - FedEx shipment creation
      - transformRateResponse() - Standardizes to DHL-compatible format
      - Helper methods for addresses, packages, customs, documents
    - Uses Phase 2 carrier-agnostic fields (dutiesPaymentType, shipmentPurpose, stateOrProvinceCode)
    - Handles FedEx-specific requirements:
        - State/province for US/CA/MX addresses
      - Address line limits (35 chars × 2 lines)
      - Customs declaration format
      - Document extraction from response
  4. test-phase3-transformers.js - Verification script
    - All 10 tests passed ✅
    - Verified interface loading, instantiation, method existence
    - Tested helper methods, package expansion, transformations

  Test Results:
  - Abstract class protection: ✅
  - Method availability: ✅ (all 7 required methods)
  - Helper methods: ✅ (isSinglePackage, getTotalPackageCount, formatDate)
  - DHL rate/shipment transformation: ✅
  - FedEx rate/shipment transformation: ✅
  - Package quantity expansion: ✅ (2 types × qty → 5 individual packages)

  Key Features:
  - ✅ Clean separation of concerns (transformation logic isolated from API clients)
  - ✅ Backward compatible (DHL logic extracted without breaking existing functionality)
  - ✅ Carrier-agnostic design (same interface for both carriers)
  - ✅ Comprehensive field mapping (addresses, packages, customs, documents)
  - ✅ Response standardization (FedEx responses → DHL-compatible format)

  Next Phase: Phase 4 - Carrier API Clients (refactor DHL carrier, create FedEx carrier)

  Would you like to proceed to Phase 4 now?
